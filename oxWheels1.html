<title>The oxen and the Wheels</title>
<h1>The Oxen and the Wheels
<h2></h1>From Aesop's Fables</h2>

<p>
     A pair of Oxen were drawing a heavily loaded wagon along a miry country road. They had to use all their strengh to pull the wagon, but they did not complain.
</p>

<p>
    The wheels of the wagon were of a diferent sort. Though the task they had to do was very light compared with that of the oxen, they creaked and groaned at every turn. The poor Oxen,
    pulling with all their might to draw the
    wagon throught the deep mud, had their ears filled with the loud complaining of the wheels. Abnd this, you may well know, made their work so much the harder to endure.
</p>

<p>
   "Silence!", the Oxen cried at least, out of pacience. "What have you Wheels to complain about so loudly? We are drawing all the weight, not youm abd we are keeping still about it 
   besides."
</p>

They complain most who suffer least.
